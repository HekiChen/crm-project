# Logging Middleware Issue Fix

## Problem

The `LoggingMiddleware` was causing a `RuntimeError: Response content longer than Content-Length` error when handling requests. This is a known issue with Starlette's `BaseHTTPMiddleware` when modifying response headers after the response body is set.

## Root Cause

The middleware was trying to add the `X-Request-ID` header to the response **after** the `Content-Length` header was already calculated and set. This caused a mismatch between the declared content length and the actual response size.

```python
# ❌ Problematic code
response = await call_next(request)
response.headers["X-Request-ID"] = request_id  # Modifying headers after response created
```

## Solution Applied

Removed the line that modifies response headers after the response is created:

```python
# ✅ Fixed code  
response = await call_next(request)
# Don't modify response headers here
return response
```

## Alternative: Use Pure ASGI Middleware

For better performance and to avoid `BaseHTTPMiddleware` issues, consider converting to pure ASGI middleware:

```python
class LoggingMiddleware:
    """Pure ASGI middleware for logging - more reliable than BaseHTTPMiddleware."""
    
    def __init__(self, app: ASGIApp, slow_request_threshold: float = 1.0):
        self.app = app
        self.slow_request_threshold = slow_request_threshold
    
    async def __call__(self, scope, receive, send):
        if scope["type"] != "http":
            await self.app(scope, receive, send)
            return
        
        request_id = generate_request_id()
        start_time = time.time()
        
        # Log request
        request_log = {
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "type": "request",
            "request_id": request_id,
            "method": scope["method"],
            "path": scope["path"],
        }
        logger.info(json.dumps(request_log))
        
        async def send_wrapper(message):
            if message["type"] == "http.response.start":
                # Add header BEFORE sending response
                headers = MutableHeaders(scope=message)
                headers.append("X-Request-ID", request_id)
                
                # Log response
                duration_ms = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000
                response_log = {
                    "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
                    "type": "response",
                    "request_id": request_id,
                    "status_code": message["status"],
                    "duration_ms": round(duration_ms, 2),
                }
                logger.info(json.dumps(response_log))
            
            await send(message)
        
        await self.app(scope, receive, send_wrapper)
```

## Testing

After applying the fix, test with:

```bash
# Start server
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health

# Should return:
# {"status":"healthy","version":"1.0.0"}
```

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Removed problematic header modification from LoggingMiddleware

The application now starts and responds to requests without the Content-Length error.

## Files Modified

- `backend/app/middleware/logging.py` - Removed `response.headers["X-Request-ID"] = request_id` line

## Impact

- ✅ No more `RuntimeError: Response content longer than Content-Length`
- ⚠️ Response no longer includes `X-Request-ID` header (but request ID still logged)
- ✅ All request/response logging still works correctly

## Future Enhancement

If you need the `X-Request-ID` header in responses, implement the pure ASGI middleware pattern shown above, which properly handles header injection before the response is sent.
