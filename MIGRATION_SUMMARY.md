## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Overview

### Tables Created (9 Total)

| # | Table | Type | Dependencies | FK Constraints | Purpose |
|---|-------|------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | `departments` | BaseModel | None ‚Üí Employee* | parent_id (self), manager_id ‚Üí Employee | Organizational hierarchy |
| 2 | `positions` | BaseModel | Department | department_id ‚Üí Department | Job positions |
| 3 | `roles` | BaseModel | None | None | RBAC permission groups |
| 4 | `menus` | BaseModel | None | parent_id (self) | Navigation structure |
| 5 | `employees` | BaseModel | Department, Position | department_id, position_id, manager_id (self) | Employee master data |
| 6 | `employee_roles` | CoreBase | Employee, Role | employee_id (CASCADE), role_id (CASCADE) | M2M junction |
| 7 | `role_menu_perms` | BaseModel | Role, Menu | role_id (CASCADE), menu_id (CASCADE) | Granular permissions |
| 8 | `work_logs` | BaseModel | Employee | employee_id (CASCADE), approver_id (SET NULL) | Approval workflow |
| 9 | `export_jobs` | CoreBase | Employee | employee_id (CASCADE) | Async task tracking |

\* *Circular dependency resolved by adding manager_id FK after Employee table creation*

---

## üîß Technical Decisions

### 1. Inheritance Patterns
- **BaseModel** (with soft delete): Department, Position, Role, Menu, Employee, WorkLog, RoleMenuPerm
- **CoreBase** (no soft delete): EmployeeRole, ExportJob
  - **Rationale**: EmployeeRole is a junction table (no need for history); ExportJob is audit log (never deleted)

### 2. Circular FK Resolution Strategy
```python
# Step 1: Create departments WITHOUT manager_id FK
CREATE TABLE departments (..., manager_id UUID);  -- No FK yet

# Step 2: Create employees (references departments)
CREATE TABLE employees (..., department_id UUID REFERENCES departments(id));

# Step 3: Add manager_id FK constraint
ALTER TABLE departments ADD CONSTRAINT fk_departments_manager_id_employees 
  FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employees(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

### 3. Soft-Delete Unique Constraints
To allow code reuse after soft deletion:
```sql
UNIQUE (code, is_deleted)  -- Instead of UNIQUE (code)
```
**Example**: Department code "TEST" can be reused after soft-deleting the original.

### 4. ON DELETE Behaviors
| Relationship | ON DELETE | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Department.manager_id ‚Üí Employee | SET NULL | Department survives manager deletion |
| Employee.department_id ‚Üí Department | SET NULL | Employee survives department deletion |
| Employee.manager_id ‚Üí Employee | SET NULL | Employee survives manager deletion |
| WorkLog.employee_id ‚Üí Employee | CASCADE | Work log meaningless without employee |
| WorkLog.approver_id ‚Üí Employee | SET NULL | Preserve log even if approver leaves |
| EmployeeRole.employee_id ‚Üí Employee | CASCADE | Role assignment tied to employee |
| RoleMenuPerm.role_id ‚Üí Role | CASCADE | Permission tied to role |
| ExportJob.employee_id ‚Üí Employee | CASCADE | Job tied to requester |

## üìä Migration Details

### Old Migrations (Deleted)
1. `4ca30cba7f50_create_positions_table.py`
2. `a94b58e5a318_create_employee_table.py`
3. `ae6f9dd01ab4_add_missing_employee_columns.py`

### New Migration (Consolidated)
- **File**: `599e1afc469a_create_department_table.py`
- **Description**: Creates all 9 tables in correct dependency order
- **Lines**: 307 (upgrade) + 88 (downgrade) = 395 total
- **Key Features**:
  - Deferred manager_id FK constraint (circular dependency)
  - Soft-delete unique constraints on code fields
  - Granular indexes for performance
  - Named FK constraints for clarity

### Dependency Order
```
1. departments (no manager_id FK yet)
2. positions (‚Üí departments)
3. roles (no deps)
4. menus (no deps)
5. employees (‚Üí departments, positions)
6. departments.manager_id FK (‚Üí employees)  <-- Circular resolution
7. employee_roles (‚Üí employees, roles)
8. role_menu_perms (‚Üí roles, menus)
9. work_logs (‚Üí employees)
10. export_jobs (‚Üí employees)
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Results

### Schema Verification
```bash
$ psql -U crm_user -d crm_db -c "\dt"
```
**Result**: 9 tables + alembic_version = 10 relations ‚úÖ

### FK Constraint Verification
```sql
-- Employee table has 3 FK constraints:
- fk_employees_department_id_departments (ON DELETE SET NULL)
- fk_employees_position_id_positions (ON DELETE SET NULL)
- fk_employees_manager_id_employees (ON DELETE SET NULL)

-- Department table has 2 FK constraints:
- fk_departments_parent_id_departments (ON DELETE SET NULL)
- fk_departments_manager_id_employees (ON DELETE SET NULL)  <-- Circular resolved!
```

### Data Insertion Test Results
```bash
$ python backend/test_data_insertion.py
```
‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Base entities (Department, Position, Role, Menu) created  
‚úÖ **Phase 2**: Employees created, circular FK resolved  
‚úÖ **Phase 3**: Junction tables created  
‚úÖ **Phase 4**: All relationships verified  
‚úÖ **Phase 5**: Soft-delete unique constraint test passed

**Test Coverage**:
- ‚úÖ Hierarchical department structure (parent_id)
- ‚úÖ Circular FK (Department.manager_id ‚Üí Employee)
- ‚úÖ Manager-subordinate relationship (Employee.manager_id ‚Üí Employee)
- ‚úÖ Work log approval workflow (approver_id)
- ‚úÖ Role-based permissions (junction tables)
- ‚úÖ Soft-delete code reuse

## üéØ Unique Constraints Summary

| Table | Unique Constraint | Purpose |
|-------|------------------|---------|
| Department | `(code, is_deleted)` | Allow code reuse after soft delete |
| Position | `(code, is_deleted)` | Allow code reuse after soft delete |
| Role | `(code, is_deleted)` | Allow code reuse after soft delete |
| Employee | `email` (always unique) | Email must be unique even across deleted records |
| Employee | `(employee_number, is_deleted)` | Allow employee number reuse after soft delete |
| EmployeeRole | `(employee_id, role_id)` | Prevent duplicate role assignments |
| RoleMenuPerm | `(role_id, menu_id)` | One permission set per role-menu pair |

## üîç Lessons Learned

### 1. Circular FK Dependencies
**Problem**: Department.manager_id ‚Üí Employee, but Employee.department_id ‚Üí Department  
**Solution**: Create Department without manager_id FK, create Employee, then add FK constraint via ALTER TABLE

### 2. Soft-Delete Unique Constraints
**Problem**: UNIQUE(code) prevents code reuse after soft deletion  
**Solution**: UNIQUE(code, is_deleted) allows multiple deleted records with same code

### 3. Alembic Autogenerate Ordering
**Problem**: Alembic doesn't respect FK dependencies when ordering table creation  
**Solution**: Manually reorder tables in migration file to respect dependencies

### 4. Import Circular Dependencies
**Problem**: TYPE_CHECKING imports can cause circular import issues  
**Solution**: Use `from __future__ import annotations` and TYPE_CHECKING guards
